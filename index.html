			<span class="image main"><img src="images/about.jpg" alt="" /></span>
			<p>I became a software engineer because I've always loved working with new technologies. I thrive in dynamic and collaborative environments and find enjoyment in creating efficient solutions to complex problems.</p>
			<p>I'm proficient in several programming languages, including Python, C++, JavaScript, and SQL. I have extensive experience in full-stack web development, mobile development and cloud computing. Recently, I've started delving into the realm of machine learning, looking to expand my skills and apply these techniques to real-world challenges. View my <a target="_blank" href="assets/resume.pdf">resume</a> for more information.</p>
			<p>Outside of work a lot of my time is spent doing jiu jitsu—a sport and an art. I'm happiest when taking quiet walks at night or eating good food. </p>

		  <p>Cofounded a startup that lets people rent out underutilized driveways or garages for long or short term parking. I've worked on all aspects of bringing this idea to life from design and development to marketing. We've pitched to many groups of investors and recently got into the top 10% of applications in the highly competitive Y-Combinator Accelerator. Currently, we've released on the App Store with an Android version coming soon.</p>

            Created a web application that helps college students get out of their social bubble to create, organize, and share bucket list items. I was in charge of the backend design and implemenation using ExpressJS. The webapp was presented to a panel of software engineers and won best overall presentation and application.
