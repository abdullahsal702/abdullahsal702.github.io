			<h2 class="major">About</h2>
			<span class="image main"><img src="images/about.jpg" alt="" /></span>
			<p>I've always loved learning to use new technologies. I became a software engineer because I like the building things. I enjoy both the process and the result. I have a love for the startup space. I thrive in fast paced environments and find enjoyment in creating efficient solutions to complex problems.
			</p>
			<p>I have extensive experience in full-stack web development, mobile development and cloud computing. The languages I'm most proficient in are Python, JavaScript, SQL, and C++. Recently, I've started delving into the realm of machine learning, looking to expand my skills and apply these techniques to real-world challenges. View my <a target="_blank" href="assets/Abdullah_Saleh_Resume.pdf">resume</a> for more information.</p>
			<p>Outside of work a lot of my time is spent doing jiu jitsu—a sport and an art. I'm happiest when taking quiet walks at night or eating good food. </p>
			<p>
				I believe the small things count—every decision and every action has a cascade of real and permanent consequences.

					<h4>RAG + Vector DB Implementation · 2024</h4>
				</div>
			</div>
		  </a>
		  <p>A web app I built to explore how AI can power real user facing products. I learned how to effectively combine retrieval (Pinecone vector search) with generation (OpenAI models) to deliver useful information, using Python to transform user queries to vector representations. I structured an AI pipeline, handled relevance and context, and integrated these components into a polished frontend built with NextJS and Typescript. </p>

            Created a web application that helps college students get out of their social bubble to create, organize, and share bucket list items. I was in charge of the backend design and implemenation using ExpressJS. The webapp was presented to a panel of software engineers and won best overall presentation and application.

		  <p>Cofounded a startup that lets people rent out unused driveways or garages for parking in NYC. I've worked on all aspects of bringing this idea to life from design and development to marketing. Our mobile app has thousands of downloads and ranked in the top 10% of applications in the highly competitive Y-Combinator Accelerator.</p>

            Worked on multiple frontend and backend projects for the Monetization and Payments Infrastructure team.

My second project was converting multiple webpages to React, TypeScript and Server-Side Includes.

            Worked on many projects covering a wide range of tools. Most notably created a final capstone appication using the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express, React, and Node). Every week we had "Tech Taste" workshops where I connected with professionals in different tech industries.
